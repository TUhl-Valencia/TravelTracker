Project: Travel Tracker DMS

The Travel Tracker DMS is a JavaFX-based application that helps users manage travel plans with persistent data stored in an SQLite database. Users can add, edit, delete, and view trips, mark them as complete, and export their trip data as a .db file.

Technologies used include Java 17 or higher, JavaFX for the graphical interface, SQLite for local storage, and JUnit 5 for testing.

To run the program, make sure Java and JavaFX are installed and configured. Run MainApp.java to start the program. Use the interface to manage trips and export data as needed.

To test functionality, run TravelServiceTest.java using JUnit 5.
